# What is Davipresence?
This is discord rich presence for Davigo! This works with the closed alpha, as well as some select custom maps. Currently does not work for Prototype 0.2.2P due to IL2CPP. Fixing that. 
## Installation
1. Install [MelonLoader 0.3.0](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) to your Davigo directory (default location is `%localappdata%\DiscordGames\Davigo Alpha - 828491273227993130\content\` for the alpha, and `%localappdata%\DiscordGames\Davigo Prototypes - 782412020942766121\content\` for the prototypes)
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/SquirrelKiev/Davipresence/releases/download/v1.0/Davipresence.dll), and move it to the `Mods` directory in your Davigo folder. 
3. Download the [Discord Game SDK](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/2.5.6/discord_game_sdk.zip), and extract `discord_game_sdk.dll` from the `discord_game_sdk.zip\lib\x86_64\` folder to the root Davigo folder (Next to `Davigo.exe`). 
4. Enjoy Rich Presence!
